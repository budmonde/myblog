# About Me

This is supposed to be my about me page. I has hobbies:

- Photography
- Hip-hop dance (mainly popping and breaking -- i suck at both)
- Game Design (hoping to use this blog as a platform to formulate and improve my abilities)
- Computer Graphics (something I can hopefully transition into a career lul)
- Japanese (I think the language is an intersting one. although i do concede that I initially picked it up cuz i watched a lot of anime)
- Anime (watch lots and lots of it. my fave are Your Name -- the more mainstream one and Yahari Ore No Seisyun LoveCome Wa Machigatteiru -- the more niche one lol)
- Film. I've been really enjoying watching films, old and new and appreciating something I didn't before (my fave films would probably be In the Mood for Love and World's End)
- Animation. This one although I think is super cool I've been noticing to a lesser extent as I don't ever see myself doing stuff related to this as much as I'd have probably been doing if I were super into this shit.
- This Blog! I'm really looking forward to how this blog will turn out lol. Really hoping this will be fun to both develop on the technical stand point (putting together an actual product that has decent source code and something that is actually maintained to a certain degree of quality) as well as from a content perspective since I hope to include my entire photo portfolio in this website along with my on and off blog posts about interesting things I find out about all mah hobbies lul.
