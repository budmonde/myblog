# Aaaaand another dummy post

I need this post so that I can debug showing multiple posts on the /blog endpoint. The idea is that when you navigate and click on an individual post, you get to the endpoint /blog:param so that you can read posts at their own endpoints lol.

Once this is done, I'll start working on making the post formatting to look actually decent and not like complete trash... which is its current state as of making this post. Well, enough blabbering I think this post has enough flufff in it.... although I feel like i should put an image here so that i can use that for helping me fix the formatting lol.
