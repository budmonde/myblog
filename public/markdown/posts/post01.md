# TNQ Fall Project

This is a proposal/planning document dedicated to the fall project we as manboard + junior manboard will be working on this fall. The fall project will feature a very lightweight publication from our side we can develop and produce by the end of the fall semester.

## Motivation

Please read the motivations carefully as the priority of our motivations below are in descending order. Notice that the actual product we would get from completing this publication is our last priority. This will be a theme throughout this document. Without further ado here are the goals for the fall publication:

1. Get manboard members to get to know each other in a working environment
2. Integrate our juniors into the community and make sure they get to know how things work in the group
3. Familiarize everyone with a workflow for producing something (like a small publication, calendar, ooor the yearbook lol)
4. Have a fun activity manboard can work on during the fall semester
5. Produce a good publication we can be show off to the greater MIT community

## Expectations

This project will not be a serious endeavor such as what we expect from producing the yearbook. However, please note that we will require enough effort from across the table so that people can work out their kinks of working with each other. This means that although we likely won't ask too many hours of work from the members but you will still have to try to make realistic estimations by when things would be done and meet your deadlines. This kind of work ethic encourages things to go more smoothly once the real work kicks in for IAP.

## Ideas for content

We are open for suggestions but so far we have:

- MIT wall calendar for 2018
- MIT Cookbook (unsure about the details for this as Chris Peterson seemed to have already assumed we're doing this specifically)
- A photoseries publication with some sort-of-theme (should be something we do not end up giving up photos we'd have rather used for the yearbook)

## Projected Timeline

**DISCLAIMER**: I'm unfamiliar with how long printing takes, how much in advance we need to get things ready to make deadlines. My initial goal is to ship everything by week or two before finals week -- as in have a booth selling our publication. This may or may not be realistic. The projected timeline below is a mere speculation that I came up on the spot. I'd love feedback on what looks realistic and what doesn't. Also, if it's completely even infeasible to ship by December, feel free to express that as well.

- Early September
    - Decide on what we're going to do.
    - Figure out how logistics of producing this work (printing, deadlines for designs, proofs, pricing, # to produce)
    - Recruit junior manboard members and present them the fall publication
- Late September - October
    - Shooting photos for the publication if needed, photopassing, layout designs
- Early November
    - Get a proof for the publication ready
- December
    - Publish
